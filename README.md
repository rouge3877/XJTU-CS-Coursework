## 👋 Description
Each branch in this repository contains code relevant to the course corresponding to the branch name. 📥 The code is typically uploaded to the repository after the course has ended (or after grades have been released 📊). *Additionally, since the code is manually uploaded only after the course has concluded, there are usually very few or no commit records.*

Please note that this repository is only for personal archival purposes due to my current skill level. Do not directly submit any of the code for your assignments. I take no responsibility for any errors or inaccuracies. ***However, you are welcome to use this repository critically in any way that might benefit your learning.*** 💪🏼
